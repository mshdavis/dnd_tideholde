## Kuo-Toa 

### Overview - [Wiki](http://forgottenrealms.wikia.com/wiki/Kuo-Toa)

Kuo-toa were a debased monstrous humanoid fish-like race that dwelt in the Underdark. They had human-like bodies and fish-like heads.

### Campaign Notes

Kuo-Toa, while primarily considered to be neutral evil follower race for Dagon, will fill something of a foil role in this campaign. The community that has set up shop near Tideholde is friendly that usual and are effectively seeking asylum from the deeper parts of the sea as Dagon works to expand his reach.
