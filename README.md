# Tideholde

The small coastal town of Tideholde has held it's annual summer festival for as long as anyone can remember. Once a private celebration of the town's relative prosperity, a recent discovery of ancient ruins off the coast has begun attracting more varied attendees. This year's festival is primed to be the largest yet, with scavengers from the ruins hawking their rune-encrusted finds eagerly, and well traveled mages, clerics, and other adventurers eager to consume them. A high priestess of Melora is also set to address the gathering, drawing devotees from near and far. It promises to be the most excitement Tideholde has ever seen, although some residents are worried about whose attentions they've won.
