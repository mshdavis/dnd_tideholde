# Part One: Setting the Bar

### Area

This encounter sequence will primarily take place in the central plaza around the pillar at the center of Tideholde. Stalls and wagons are still clustered around, but the crowd thins out quickly.

### Introduction

In the beginning of this section, the crowd descends into chaos as goblins start to swarm into the plaza from the south. Despite the cluster of stalls and wagons, the plaza empties quickly and the goblins begin to loot and set things on fire.

If the PCs are paying attention, they'll notice a small scuffle near the base of the pillar as the mayor exchanges heated words with the high priestess until one of her paladins shoves him away roughly. He continues to protest as the priestess gathers both ingots into a sack, but the militia are busy attempting to repel the assault, and her paladins have made no effort to help.

If the players attempt to fight on their own terms, they can pick their initial starting position in the square. If they attempt to flee, they are ambushed, and their attackers will get a free round.

### Encounter

#### Phase One

5 [Goblins](../../appendices/bestiary.md#goblin) initially surround the PCs and attack.

After a couple of them have been killed, the survivors call for help, and 2-4 more goblins either disengage from the guard or jump away from pillaging a wagon to join in the fight.

#### Intermission

After the PCs have dispatched their first wave opponents, they notice that the priestesses entourage have been beset themselves, the paladins gradually thinning out their attackers while the priestess and the mayor deal with any that slip through their guards. Once only a few goblins remain though, the mayor snatches one of the ingots from the priestess's bag and flees quickly out of the plaza. Enraged, the priestess lashes out and finishes off the rest of the goblins before taking off after the mayor, half of her paladins in tow. After they leave, more goblins enter the plaza, this time accompanied by a couple humans in cloaks, tentacle and fish head pendants proudly displayed on their chests.

#### Phase Two

6 [Goblins](../../appendices/bestiary.md#goblin) initially surround the PCs and attack.

2-3 [Cultists](../../appendices/bestiary.md#cultist) hang back and support the goblin charge with spells until they run out of spell slots.

At the beginning of this fight, one of the goblins should attempt to run away. One of the cultists should use [inflict wounds](../../appendices/spells.md#inflict-wounds) to kill the fleeing goblin and cow the others.

Once most of the goblins have been killed, any remaining cultists with at least one spell slot left should use [command](../../appendices/spells.md#command) to force one of the other goblins in the area to join in.

Any improv dialog from the cultists should hint at how disposable they see the goblins and how more horrific things are to come.

### Conclusion

After the PCs finish fighting off the second goblin assault, it seems as though the militia has also succeeded in driving them out of the rest of the town. There's not too much time to rest though, as a fuming High Priestess returns to the town plaza and marches right up to the PCs, accusing them of being the mayor's accomplices in what she describes as "heretical theft", and threatening them loudly unless they give up the mayor's location.

After a brief conversation, the PCs interrogation is interrupted by the militia captain, who comes over and separates the PCs and the Priestess's entourage. Quickly, we learn that the mayor has been found dead in a side street, an elven arrow in his back and the silver ingot gone. He asks the PCs to tell him everything they saw, and more quietly, promises significant rewards if they can help him prove it was the elven contingent.

In a huff, the Priestess loudly denies any involvement in the mayor's death, and, promising retribution against the entire town unless the ingot is returned, she and her guards retreat to their camp outside of Tideholde.
